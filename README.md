# Roku Flashback 22
Similar to a Netflix Clone. 

# Setup

Clone the frontend and backend Roku Flashback repos to your local computer. <br>
Make sure all repos, including the "Roku_Flashback" movie api are in your local WAMP/MAMP directory. 
Make sure your WAMP/MAMP is running. Import the database `db_roku_flashback` found in the database folder. <br>
Add the provided media files. <br>

## Back end:

In terminal window:<br>
`cd RokuBack`<br>
`npm install`<br>
`node app`<br>
This should get the back end running on port:3000

## front end:

In terminal window: <br>
`cd rokufront`<br>
`npm install`<br>
`npm run serve`<br>
This should get the frontend hosted on your localhost:8080/#/. <br>
We recommend you open this project in a modern browser, ideally Chrome of firefox. If bug occurs and project opens to Home.vue, use the address bar to navigate to `localhost:8080/#/`.
